**Takeaway:** Hit a milestone! My portfolio [1chooo.com](https://1chooo.com) recently reached [300+ stars](https://github.com/1chooo/portfolio/stargazers) on GitHub!

[1chooo.com](https://1chooo.com) taught me a powerful lesson: building great software is a lot like **compound interest**. At first, you put in tons of effort, and no one really notices. But if you consistently contribute valuable work to the community, the impact eventually compounds—and so does the admiration you earn. So, I think it's a great time to share how I've experienced this **"software compound interest"** through my open-source journey.

## Star History

Here is the star history chart of [1chooo.com](https://1chooo.com), a project I started developing on [January 6, 2024](https://github.com/1chooo/portfolio/commit/992313a3ed36cd427b4cf4c557b1b53492e68e57). After more than a year of development, the project had fewer than 50 stars. Honestly, for a personal project without any promotion, that's still pretty good—but not quite satisfying, especially considering the amount of hard work put into it. Then, one small change turned everything around: I started promoting it. That changed the game completely.

## Game Changer

Through open-source, I've made a bunch of friends on GitHub. One day, while chatting with my friend [@m4xshen](https://github.com/m4xshen), he shared how his success in the open-source community came from actively engaging with others. He strongly encouraged me to start posting and promoting my work.

So, I recorded a one-minute demo using [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio/) and posted it on Reddit:

Then—**boom**! That's when I truly started to feel the **compound interest** of doing open-source. I gained over 100 stars in less than a week. All the effort I had quietly invested over the past year suddenly began to pay off. It was incredible to see my work finally being appreciated!

On Reddit, I also received a lot of valuable feedback—people suggested ways to improve the design and offered encouragement. That feedback was not only helpful, but also motivating. The positive momentum, both from GitHub stars and community comments, really meant a lot.

## More Exposure

What's more, after posting on Reddit, my project was reposted on Twitter (X), which led to the second **exponential boost** in stars—another wave of that software compound interest kicking in.

## Iteration

So far, we've talked about the value I've gained from GitHub—but just as important is what I've learned from evolving the **tech stack** behind the project.

To keep improving my portfolio, I've iterated from basic **HTML/CSS/JS** to **React**, then **Next.js**, and eventually **Turborepo** to manage the codebase at scale. Now, it's a **2000+ commit** repo that continues to grow.

Along the way, I built a Markdown-based post system, optimized **Lighthouse scores** close to 100, and improved **SEO metadata**. I also learned how to manage **npm packages** in a monorepo and prevent version conflicts.

Each iteration made me a better developer—and taught me how to build scalable, maintainable software.

## Compound

This is exactly what I mean by **Software Compound Interest**: when you consistently invest time, passion, and care into a project, the value accumulates quietly. Each small improvement compounds over time, building up until your steady effort surpasses its **maximum static friction**. At that point, what felt like slow growth suddenly turns into exponential momentum, and the results accelerate beyond what you imagined.

So if you're building something, keep going. Even when no one's watching. **Especially when no one's watching.**

Ultimately, this is the power of software compound interest: consistent effort, even in the quiet moments, always compounds into unexpected and exponential rewards.
